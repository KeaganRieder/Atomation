# About
Atomation is an Automation colony-simulation game, set in a post apoclicyse. Where the goal thats currently plann is to have the player mange 
an eventaully automate the survail of a colony, well cleaning the planet. evetually relasiing this in some regard is the long term goal.

However currently it's serving as a way for me to learn both more about C# and the Godot game engine.
