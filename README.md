# About
Atomation is an Automation colony-simulation game set in a post-apocalyptic. Where the goal that is currently planned to have the player manage 
and eventually automate the survival of a city, as well as clean the planet. Eventually, releasing this in some regard is the long-term goal.

However, currently, it's serving as a way for me to learn more about C# and the Godot game engine.
